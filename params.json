There is documentation on how to use the Bubasists web\r\napplication here http://www.ebi.ac.uk/fgpt/sw/bubastis/index.html. \r\n\r\n# Building\r\n\r\nThe Bubasist Java library can be built using maven. \r\n\r\n```\r\nmvn clean package\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\n\r\n```\r\nUsage:\r\njava -jar bubastis.jar parameters:\r\n(required)  -ontology1 location of ontology 1 either a URL for an ontology on the web or a local file location in obo or owl format. Typically the older version of the ontologies being compared\r\n(required)  -ontology2 location of ontology 2 either a URL or local file location of an obo or owl format ontology. Typically the newer version of the ontologies being compared.\r\n(optional)  -output location of output file to send results, default is to console.\r\n(optional)  -format required format of diff report, default is plain text, value 'xml' will produce xml\r\n(optional)  -xslt for xml version of the diff report this will insert an xslt location into the header for rendering these in a customised manner in a web page. Value should be location of xslt file.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\nLoading two files locally and outputting results to console:\r\njava -jar bubastis.jar -ontology1 \"H://obi_nov_08.owl\" -ontology2 \"H://obi_jan_09.owl\"\r\n\r\nLoading two files locally and output results to xml file with an xslt location inserted into header\r\njava -jar bubastis.jar -1 \"H://obi_nov_08.owl\" -2 \"H://obi_jan_09.owl\" -output \"H://OBIdiff.xml\" -format xml -xslt \"./stylesheets/bubastis.xslt\"\r\n\r\nLoading one file locally and one from the web and outputting results to plain text:\r\njava -jar bubastis.jar -ontology1 \"H://disease_ontology_version_1.owl\" -ontology2 \"http://www.disease.org/diseaseontology_latest.owl\" -output \"C://my_diff.txt\" \r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
